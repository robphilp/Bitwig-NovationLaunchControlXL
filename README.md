## Novation LaunchControl XL for Bitwig 2

### Introduction

This is a work in progress!!

### Controls

Only a single mode so far - please use User mode 1.

- The "Record Arm" acts as a shift control. Hold and then use up/down/right buttons to move scene and trigger the scene
- The "Track Focus" buttons trigger clips and show the state of clips in the scene (empty/filled/queued/playing)
- The "Track Control" buttons stop the playing clip
- Volume, sends and pan work as you would expect, and have "soft takeover" ability so no jumping values (I hope)

### The future

I will also add ability to scroll left and right for more than 8 tracks and try to make it work with unfolded groups.
At present you can use a single nested group but it behaves oddly with the group unfolded

I am getting more confident with the API and my code structure so I intend to add features for macro controls,
device controls, mute, solo etc
